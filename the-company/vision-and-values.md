**Headless/ PWA development**\


Website performance is what makes or breaks businesses nowadays. When we talk about static websites, the first thing that comes to mind is a bunch of web pages coded using HTML, CSS, and JS. Just plain text and graphics-based interface with no interactive features and real-time processing whatsoever to facilitate the visitors.[\
